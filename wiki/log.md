Append-only. Newest entries at the bottom. Format: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] <ingest|query|lint> | <short description>`

## [2026-09-10] lint | initial wiki scaffold created

Set up `wiki/` (index.md, log.md, manufacturers/, models/, concepts/,
sources/) and root `CLAUDE.md` schema over the existing `MANUALS/` raw
collection (Bruno, Golden, Pride, Prism — 97 manuals total: corrected from
an initial miscount of 87). Wrote manufacturer stub pages from
filename/folder structure only — no manual content has been read yet.
Next step: ingest manuals one at a time (or by cluster) per the workflow
in `CLAUDE.md`.

## [2026-09-10] ingest | Bruno SRE-2010 — 2010-TS Tech Support Guide

## [2026-09-10] ingest | Bruno SRE-2010 — SRE-2010 Folding Rail Install Manual (also covers SRE-3050)

## [2026-09-10] ingest | Bruno SRE-3050 — 3050-I Install Manual

## [2026-09-10] ingest | Bruno SRE-3050 — 3050-O Operator Manual

## [2026-09-10] ingest | Bruno SRE-3050 — 3050-TS Tech Support Guide

## [2026-09-10] ingest | Bruno SRE-3000 — SRE-3000 Installation Manual

Ingested the full Bruno Straight SL cluster (6 manuals, all of
`MANUALS/Bruno/Bruno Straight SL/`). Created model pages [[SRE-2010]],
[[SRE-3000]], [[SRE-3050]] and concept pages
[[Overspeed-Safety-Brake]], [[Folding-Rail]], [[Rail-Mounting-Guidance]] —
all three concepts turned out to be genuinely shared across Bruno's
Straight SL line (same mechanisms, often the same document reused
verbatim across models). Updated [[Bruno]] and `index.md` accordingly.
Also corrected file-count errors in the original scaffold: Bruno has 20
manuals on disk (not 12), Golden has 66 (not 64).

## [2026-09-10] ingest | Bruno VPL-3100B — Install Manual

## [2026-09-10] ingest | Bruno VPL-3100B — Operator Manual (Trilingual)

## [2026-09-10] ingest | Bruno VPL-3200B — Install Manual

## [2026-09-10] ingest | Bruno VPL-3200B — Operator Manual (EN/FR)

Ingested the full Bruno VPL cluster (4 manuals, all of
`MANUALS/Bruno/VPL/`). Created model pages [[VPL-3100B]] and [[VPL-3200B]]
— Bruno's smaller porch-lift and larger multi-floor hoistway lift,
respectively, sharing the same Acme-screw-drive architecture but differing
sharply in install complexity (VPL-3200B ships as a two-half tower joined
on site via a coiled-spring-pin drive-screw splice) and emergency
operation (VPL-3200B adds an electrical emergency-lowering key switch
outside the hoistway; VPL-3100B has only the manual hand wheel). Created
concept pages [[Top-Landing-Gate-Installation]] (gate hardware/procedure
reused verbatim across both models) and
[[Battery-Charger-LED-Diagnostics]] (same LED table reused verbatim across
both install and both operator manuals). Updated [[Bruno]] and `index.md`
accordingly — Bruno's Straight SL and VPL product lines are now fully
ingested; Curved SL and Vehicle Lifts remain backlog.
